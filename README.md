# Discovery customer sentiment from product reviews

In this Code Pattern, we walk you through a working example of a web application that queries and manipulates data from the Watson Discovery Service. This web app contains multiple UI components that you can use as a starting point for developing your own Watson Discovery Service applications. 

The main benefit of using the Watson Discovery Service is its powerful analytics engine that provides cognitive enrichments and insights into your data. This app provides examples of how to showcase these enrichments through the use of filters, lists and graphs. The key enrichments that we will focus on are:

* Entities - people, companies, organizations, cities, and more.
* Categories - classification of the data into a hierarchy of categories up to 5 levels deep.
* Concepts - identified general concepts that aren't necessarily referenced in the data.
* Keywords - important topics typically used to index or search the data.
* Entity Types - 
* Relations - 
* Sentiment - the overall positive or negative sentiment of each document.

For this Code Pattern, we will be using data that contains food reviews.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:
* Load and enrich data in the Watson Discovery Service.
* Query and manipulate data in the Watson Discovery Service.
* Create UI components to represent enriched data created by the Watson Discovery Service.
* Build a complete web app that utilizes popular JavaScript technologies to feature Watson Discovery Service data and enrichments.

## Flow
1. The food review json files are added to the Discovery collection.
2. The user interacts with the backend server via the app UI. The frontend app UI uses React to render search results and can reuse all of the views that are used by the backend for server side rendering. The frontend is using semantic-ui-react components and is responsive.
3. User input is processed and routed to the backend server, which is responsible for server side rendering of the views to be displayed on the browser. The backend server is written using express and uses express-react-views engine to render views written using React.
4. The backend server sends user requests to the Watson Discovery Service. It acts as a proxy server, forwarding queries from the frontend to the Watson Discovery Service API while keeping sensitive API keys concealed from the user.

### How does Watson Knowledge Studio work?

The image below explains the process of how Watson Knowledge Studio works in light detail. For greater detail see Steps [4. Upload Type System](#4-upload-type-system) through [9. Deploy the machine learning model to NLU](#9-deploy-the-machine-learning-model-to-nlu).

![](doc/source/images/wks-nlu-process.png)

In short, a type system is built and supporting documents are uploaded that have domain specific wording. From here a model must be built to properly understand the documents, this is where the annotations come in. Once the corpus and annotations are set you are free to create a model and deploy it to a Watson Natural Language Understanding instance.

> Note: see [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md) for project structure.

# Steps

Use the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button **OR** create the services and run locally.

## Deploy to IBM Cloud

[![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://metrics-tracker.mybluemix.net/stats/c612c58fcbb9552f348a4e0e5e148846/button.svg)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/watson-discovery-food-reviews)

1. Press the above ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button and then click on ``Deploy``.

2. In Toolchains, click on Delivery Pipeline to watch while the app is deployed. Once deployed, the app can be viewed by clicking 'View app'.

![](doc/source/images/toolchain-pipeline.png)

3. To see the app and services created and configured for this journey, use the IBM Cloud dashboard. The app is named `watson-discovery-food-reviews` with a unique suffix. The following services are created and easily identified by the `wdfr-` prefix:
    * wdfr-discovery-service

## Run locally
> NOTE: These steps are only needed when running locally instead of using the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button.

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create IBM Cloud services](#2-create-ibm-cloud-services)
3. [Load the Discovery files](#3-load-the-discovery-files)
4. [Configure credentials](#4-configure-credentials)
5. [Run the application](#5-run-the-application)

### 1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/watson-discovery-food-reviews
```

### 2. Create IBM Cloud services

Create the following services:

* [**Watson Discovery**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/discovery)

### 3. Load the Discovery files

Launch the **Watson Discovery** tool. Create a **new data collection**
and give the data collection a unique name.

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="doc/source/images/create-collection.png">
</p>

From the new collection data panel, under `Configuration` click the `Switch` button to create a new configuration file that will include extracting keywords as a function of data enrichment. Give the configuration file a unique name.

![Create config file](doc/source/images/create-keyword-config.gif)

> Note: failure to do this will result in no `keywords` being shown in the app. 

From the new collection data panel, under `Add data to this collection` use `Drag and drop your documents here or browse from computer` to seed the content with the json files extracted from `data/food_reviews/`.

> Note: If you don't load files, they will be automatically added when you run `npm start`.

![Upload data to collection](doc/source/images/add-docs-to-collection.gif)

> Save the **environment_id** and **collection_id** for your `.env` file in the next step.

### 4. Configure credentials
```
cp env.sample .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with the necessary settings.

#### `env.sample:`

```
# Replace the credentials here with your own.
# Rename this file to .env before starting the app.

# Watson Discovery
DISCOVERY_USERNAME=<add_discovery_username>
DISCOVERY_PASSWORD=<add_discovery_password>
DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID=<add_discovery_environment>
DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID=<add_discovery_collection>

# Run locally on a non-default port (default is 3000)
# PORT=3000

```

### 5. Run the application
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime or NPM.
1. Start the app by running `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.
1. Access the UI by pointing your browser at `localhost:3000`.
> Note: `PORT` can be configured in `.env`.

# Troubleshooting

* Error: Environment {GUID} is still not active, retry once status is active

  > This is common during the first run. The app tries to start before the Discovery
environment is fully created. Allow a minute or two to pass. The environment should
be usable on restart. If you used `Deploy to IBM Cloud` the restart should be automatic.

* Error: Only one free environment is allowed per organization

  > To work with a free trial, a small free Discovery environment is created. If you already have a Discovery environment, this will fail. If you are not using Discovery, check for an old service thay you may want to delete. Otherwise use the .env DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID to tell the app which environment you want it to use. A collection will be created in this environment using the default configuration.

* Error when loading files into Discovery

  > Loading all 2000 document files at one time into Discovery can sometimes lead to "busy" errors. If this occurs, start over and load a small number of files at a time.

* No keywords appear in the app

  > This can be due to not having a proper configuration file assigned to your data collection. See [Step 3](#3-load-the-discovery-files) above.

# Privacy Notice

If using the `Deploy to IBM Cloud` button some metrics are tracked, the following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/IBM/metrics-tracker-service) service on each deployment:

* Node.js package version
* Node.js repository URL
* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Application GUID (`application_id`)
* Application instance index number (`instance_index`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)
* Labels of bound services
* Number of instances for each bound service and associated plan information

This data is collected from the `package.json` and `repository.yaml` file in the sample application and the ``VCAP_APPLICATION`` and ``VCAP_SERVICES`` environment variables in IBM Cloud and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Cloud to measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

## Disabling Deployment Tracking

To disable tracking, simply remove `require("metrics-tracker-client").track();` from the ``index.js`` file in the ``server`` directory.
