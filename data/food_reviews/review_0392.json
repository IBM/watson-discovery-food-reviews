It reminds me of the taste of Tim Horton's Iced Cappuccino with the caramel flavoring. I made it hot and it was delicious. Then I made it with ice and it was even better!<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to buy this flavor because I saw a negative review and it came in a 36 count package. I didn't want to have to throw out that many Kcups if it was awful. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />We just started using our Keurig a few days ago so we're still testing out all of the good flavors. I've got this on my list of Kcups to stock up on in the future! The Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino is our second favorite flavor at the moment; our favorite is the Celestial Seasonings Sweet Southern Tea.<br /><br />Note: This cappuccino is very sweet. We love sweet drinks so this is great for us. I think it's perfect. However, if you don't like sweet drinks, you may not care for this."}
