The first several ingredients were either corn, corn filler or byproducts.  With a name like Beneful and the pictures representing healthy ingredients the consumer is too believe that the ingredients are top notch, the best there is for your dog.<br /><br />That's far from the truth, and with the lackluster appetite my dog had for the food I gave away the bag to local animal shelter and they didn't even want it and in turn gave it away to some other agency.  What else can be said when a local animal shelter doesn't even want a bag of Beneful.<br /><br />The proof is in the bag.  Filler ingredients, that are neither fit for beast or beast, let alone to be purchased from man.  Do your dog a favor and buy something else."}
