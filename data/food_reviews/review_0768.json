My milk was not enough for him, and I did not like the ingredients in baby formula (all had soy and most have cows milk protein, not to mention 45% corn syrup solids).  My pediatrician recommended this powdered goats milk because they add folate (not normally found in goats milk).  Since I have been feeding my son this milk, he has been SO happy and growing so much better! Have not had to add any vitamins/supplements to it to make it a whole food, it is fine on its own. Although, I have been using organic brown rice cereal because he is getting close to being ready for solids.  LOVE this milk! (always consult your doctor before changing your babies diet)"}
