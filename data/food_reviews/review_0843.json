A golden retriever, 12 years old, a pug that is 7 yrs old and a papillion that is 2 yrs old.  I placed the Beneful out on their feed dish this morning after removing the \"other product\" that they usually get in the morning.  The usual response is one of boredom.  \"We'll get to it when we get around to it.\"  This morning there was a rush to the bowl to get their equal share of this new dog food.<br />The appearance of the product is good and one I felt good about giving to me dogs.  Vibrant, healthy looking colors made me feel like they were getting some healthy vegetables in the mix too.<br />This definitely warrants a suggestion from me to consider buying this product for your dogs.  In addition the name Purina makes me feel like I am giving my loved pets something that will be good for them."}
