It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma. But the granules are quite big, however -- bigger than plain refined sugar. This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together. But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it, or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it, it is a great product. It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer."}
