The coffee is good overall, and GREAT for the PRICE.  Signing up for AutoDelivery gets you a price per serving that cannot be touched in the K-Cup universe.  Big whoop, so you have to store the unused balance of the dozen per bag in a ziplock bag ---> for several dollars per box I can handle that!"}
