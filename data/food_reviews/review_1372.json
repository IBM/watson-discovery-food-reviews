Once we got the cookie packages out of the huge outer box, pushing aside all the bags of air, and then grabbing the inner box (what would be shipped to a supermarket), we found that we had some darned tasty cookies.  Real chocolate chips and a generous amount per cookie, enough to say that it would be tough to take a bite of cokie without getting a chip.  The batter holding things together was good, without nuts or any strong flavoring that would keep it from overpowering the taste of the chocolate.  Nicely crunchy,  as is normal for box cookies.  No one will ever mistake these for homemade, but they are pretty good for packaged cookies."}
