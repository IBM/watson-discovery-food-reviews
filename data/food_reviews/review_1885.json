Valentine \"I am out to prove I have nothin...","HelpfulnessNumerator":2,"HelpfulnessDenominator":2,"Score":5,"date":"2007-01-26","Summary":"Straight from Jamaica","Text":"I was not expecting this coffee to actually be shipped from Jamaica, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a FedEx International package at my door.  One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other \"Jamaica grown\" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price."}
