I mean the first ingredient is sugar.  Then there's PGPR, I believe a preservative, that also, was never an ingredient, years ago.  Soy which is an  allergen to many as well as eggs.<br /><br />Ok, enough of that rant.<br /><br />I have been trying to find a substitute and you can see a review of another honey mint I recently tried. I wasn't totally thrilled.<br /><br />So yesterday while at my health food store I bought one Honey Acre mint and gave it a try and wow, so yummy!!!  The filling is creamy and the chocolate a velvet consistency and the mint, well minty!  Had I known, I would have bought more than 1.<br /><br />Sooooo, I just ordered a box of these and they will be my official peppermint patty addiction. :O)"}
