For her, it starts and ends very sweet, for me (and most people in the world) it starts sweet and ends bitter.  After we tried the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LXYA5Q\">Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets</a>tablet, there was a small difference for both of us.  For me, the bitterness subsided a small amount-- not even enough to worth mentioning.  For her, the grapefruit tasted like one of the \"sweetest\" ones she'd ever had.<br /><br />However, the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes.  Both of which tasted noticeably better.  However, the effect of a single tablet wore off completely within 5 minutes.  To be honest, I hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour, but as is, you're paying quite a bit per minute for these things (we paid ~$20 for ten tablets w/ shipping).<br /><br />Would I try it again?  After the tablets we have left are finished, I think not.  I already enjoy gala apples, bananas, watermelon, oranges, and strawberries without this tablet-- I can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit, lemons or limes DIRECTLY (lemon and lime are fine in foods).<br /><br />If you're dead-set on trying these tablets, try it with some of your friends, but don't expect too much."}
