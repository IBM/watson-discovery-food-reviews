Of course, here in Iraq we look forward to receiving care packages and the awesome snacks they contain.  However, this snack was the \"Cat's Meow\".  It is honestly the best snack mix I have ever tasted and my fellow Marines agree on this also.  Once it was eaten by all, everyone was inquiring where I had received it and I could only say a caring patriot who included it in one of their care box of goodies.<br /><br />  I loved it so much that I ended up on this page because I decided to go online and search for it, and see if I can get multiple packages of this shipped to my unit here in Iraq.  I don't mind paying a few extra bucks for it, to have for me and my fellow Marines to enjoy.  It's just that good that it's worth it!!!<br /><br />  This is a great product and all should try it.  After you do, you won't think that Chex Mix can light even a dim candle next to the UTZ PUB MIX.  Believe me, try it, and you'll want to keep this stocked in your cabinet for everyone in your family and their friends to enjoy."}
