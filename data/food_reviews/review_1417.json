All organic ingredients that i actually understand on the label compared to the usual junk I buy my beagle.  While she is not picky about what she eats, she usually behaves much more enthusiastic about a pupperoni treat vs a milk bone.  With these ranch style treats, she seems to act as if they are the pupperoni style treats so I assume they taste good to her! I also like the fact that these treats are hard like regular dog bones as that is needed for dogs to maintain healthy teeth (among other things).  Considering what we spend on food and treats for our beloved beagle, I will gladly add these to the monthly list."}
