I love the plain/original Oskri coconut bars. They have a nice texture. I like Mounds and wanted a slightly healthier version. These could be that, but this box was way below quality. It seems like it is old because most of the bars I have tried have discolored chocolate and the coconut is dried out. One of the bars even had a bad seal so that I didn't even have to rip it open and it was completely dried out. The plain bars are not dry at all, so these really did not meet the standards I was expecting. Won't buy these again, but that is probably best because the sugar content is high, even though it is superior to corn syrup."}
