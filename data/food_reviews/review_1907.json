I love having these sodium/msg-packed instant noodles every once in awhile when I'm too lazy to make lunch or dinner. I don't know if you'd actually call these \"seafood\" flavored, though there are little dried fish cakes and plenty of seaweed in them, but they are somehow indescribably good. I actually like the original flavor better, but since these were cheaper, I went with it.<br /><br />I've seen these with cheaper prices at asian supermarkets when it's on sale, but if you \"subscribe\" to this on amazon, it's worth an extra dollar or two not to make a trip to the market. When I cook these, I usually add an egg, some veggies, and leftover meat (or whatever is in the fridge). The seafood flavor packet is strong so it adds lots of flavor to everything else.<br /><br />When I got these delivered, none of my ramen were crushed, so it really depends on how carefully your delivery company treats the boxes. Anyway, I'd suggest buying one packet at a store first to try it before committing to a whole box."}
