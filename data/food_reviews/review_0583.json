I have bought this brand before in the bean version at costco and it was good.  The coffee was bold and smooth. Had less waste than a regular k-cup. Since the pod  below doesnt have a shell, I suggest once the plastic is opened, place them in an airtight container until used. I'd recommend consuming the 12 pack with a few days to a week.  Can't wait to try the other versions of this coffee. I will buy again."}
