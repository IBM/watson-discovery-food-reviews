I dislike drinking plain water and have been looking for something easy that I could add to my s/s water bottle (gotta be good to the environment, right?)  The flavor is great, ease of convenience is wonderful and the hint of sweet is not overpowering at all.  I can drink my green tea with or without sweetener.  The only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long, the calories WILL add up - I think each packet is 60 calories.  I drink 2 (32 oz) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day.  But I will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab.  I'd just pick something else if I'm going to pound water all day long (perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is NOT sweetened - it's excellent as well)  I'll use this for one bottle and a non-sweetened one for the other.  Best of both worlds.  Enjoy!"}
