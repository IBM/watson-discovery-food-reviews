We have tried several different brands and they have all been good.  This is by far our favorite.  The flavor is excellent and it is always a joy to open the bottle and pour out this delicious treat.  Works great on pancakes/waffles/french toast as well as in cookies/baked goods and sauces (my favorite...part of the glaze I use on smoked ribs...mmmmmmmmmmm).  Amazon has an amazing price on an amazing product.  This is our 3rd bottle of Anderson's Grade B and we will continue to purchase it as along as it is available."}
