I thought I would give the fog chaser a try. The price was nice and I liked the idea of alot less plastic. I could tell when I opened the box that I was going to love the taste! Nice strong coffee!! Brought some to work with me and one of the Doctors I work with is going to order some. Will be ordering more myself."}
