I steeped one tea bag for a few minutes just to wet the leaves and then tore it open. I combined the wet tea leaves w/one teaspoon plain organic yogurt and spread the mix on my face. I soaked a washcloth in the hot tea water and when it was cool enough, placed it over my face and relaxed for 30 min. My skin feels so much better in just one application; much less irritated and it feels moisturized and calm. I highly recommend giving this a try for anyone who might have acne and have \"tried everything.\" If you don't want the mess and might be having a breakout in just one small area, simply place a warm teabag on your skin without removing the insides and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Of course, drink the tea as well to cleanse from the inside out."}
