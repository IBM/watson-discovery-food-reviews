After about a week, we finally opened up a package and then kicked ourselves for not having tried them earlier.  There is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort.  We took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag.  I used them, from another bag, as a garnish on a salad that I took to the pot luck and we came home with an empty salad bowl!<br />We will definitely order these again.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWLUGU\">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Red Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>"}
