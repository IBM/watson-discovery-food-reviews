You can use it as a lotion after bathing, put in your hair, roll it around in your mouth to collect bacteria (spit it out after 2 minutes) cook with it, shine your shoes with it but the very best is it makes your face feel wonderful all day.  It is by far the best night/day cream and it absorbs quickly so there is no greasy feel.  Love it!!!"}
