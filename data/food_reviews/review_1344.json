The price is insane for what is essentially a glorified ice cube tray, which does not work as well as your basic ice cube tray. It's difficult to get the cubes out of this tray, it has an odd shape that wastes space in your freezer, and it makes 2 ounce servings, which are fine if you know you want 2 ounces, but I prefer to make 1 ounce sizes so that I can combine different flavors, or make just 1 (or 3) ounces if my baby is not as hungry and I don't want any waste. The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because of the lid - that IS handy, I must admit. But you can buy ice cube trays with lids too, that will actually fit in your freezer and stack well. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. Okay, it IS cute. I wish it wasn't so cute..."}
