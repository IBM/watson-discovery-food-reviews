After a few medical emergencies and educating myself WHY cats are not designed by Mother Nature to eat dry kibble (ANY brand), I changed our clan of felines to HEALTHY wet food.<br />Every cat with a blocked urinary tract is fine, until they start to strain to urinate and have to be rushed to the ER.<br />With all the issues of recalls and such concerning the pet food industry, we rotate 3 different brands of food. Felidae is one.  It has NO grains, soy, corn, or icky fillers. Felidae is a pate loaf-like consistency.<br />Since changing to a wet food only diet, none of our cats have been back to ER in years.  None throw up.  No runny eyes.  Coats are shiny. No matted hair.  All are at a perfect weight.  The changes are amazing.<br />Having 5 cats, I am VERY thankful for the 13 oz size cans of Felidae.<br />I had a question recently and sent Felidae an email.  They answered very promptly and were very kind.  Their customer service deserves 5 stars also."}
