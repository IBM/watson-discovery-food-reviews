Am I an expert at Ice Tea?  No, but after moving to the South some 25 years ago, I have tasted lots of iced tea and this one makes as good as you can find anywhere.  I will say that most recipes I could find must have been for some cheap tea bags (weak, somewhat tasteless and bitter), so I experimented a little and found a great recipe for this loose leaf tea.  The recipe is 1/4 cup tea to 8 cups water.  Bring the water to a boil take it off the heat, put the tea in, let it steep for NO MORE THAN 5 minutes and strain into a container, let cool to room temperature and refrigerate.  If you are in a hurry, fill a glass with ice and pour the tea over the ice.  This works great for this particular loose leaf tea - not strong, not weak.  Oh yes, if you like sweet tea, add the sugar to the container while the tea is hot."}
