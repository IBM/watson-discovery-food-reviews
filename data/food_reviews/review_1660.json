It's an especially great product for kids, because they think they are getting soda, but it's really just fancy juice that's (GULP!) good for them!<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry flavor is sweet, but it's a natural flavor that derives its sweetness from fruit juices. Overall, it's definitely an enjoyable product."}
