It's definitely not like Kraft nor Road's End, but there's something distinctly cheese-like about it and I found it to be delicious!  I added both peas and broccoli and was pleasantly suprised to find that the cheese sauce was plentiful enough for all of the pasta, peas, and broc.  I also must say, as my first time trying to cook gluten-free pasta on my own, this was painless and didn't crumble apart (like it could have).  I gave it 4 stars, not quite perfect, but definitely a great treat (every once in awhile, for those of us on a budget)."}
