For some reason a few years ago all of the stores in my area stopped carrying the sugar free KoolAid.  I like the new pouches that are in the tubes rather than the old tubs that were stacked, they are easy open and pour nicely into the bottom of the pitcher.  There is less of the particles stirred up into the air from the pouches, as they stream the powder out rather than it just dumping in a blob from the tubs."}
