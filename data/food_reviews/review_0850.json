My dog, a Terrier/ Husky mix is not a picky eater and so is loves just about any kind of dog food scooped into his bowl. The packaging as other reviewers have noted does suggest wholesome ingredients that are quite absent from the actual ingredients listed on the back. After he finishes this bag, I might consider investing in slightly more expensive brands as other reviewers have noted."}
