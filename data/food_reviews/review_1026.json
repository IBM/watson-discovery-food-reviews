There is no indication in the item description that this is the case. I fully agree with another reviewer that this item also is so extremely salty that it cannot be consumed. The MSG also heightens the very salty taste. This item did puff up very nicely in the microwave, but it was inedible because of the saltiness and all 18 packages had to be thrown out. For that reason, I am surprised at the many excellent reviews of this product. Amazon.com gets an A+++ for their wonderful handling of this problem."}
