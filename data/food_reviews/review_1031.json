Microwave with care!","Text":"I first tried Lowrey's Bacon Curls when they were offered at a local club store. Since then, the only way to find them had been to order them streight from the manufacturer, until now. I'd had mixed results with the microwave process. I'd had many bags just burn without popping. Recently...just for fun, I thought I'd see what would happen if I tried lower wattage. It worked!! Now I use my 900 watt microwave vs the 1100 watt microvave I'd initially used."}
