Boy, was I disappointed and disgusted! I tried with all my might to get through a fourth of the cup but I simply could not do it. This so-called cappuccino tasted greasy and overly sweet at the same time. I did not even know that was possible for a caffeine product. I would have rather had gas station cappuccino than this garbage. I wish there were a way for me to return the 22 K-Cups that are left but, sadly, they will just end up in the trash. What a waste of my hard-earned money."}
