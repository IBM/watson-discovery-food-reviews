My order came in, as described, with- dark, white, milk, hazelnut and peanut butter truffles. Although, I would have loved either product to have shown up on my doorstep for the price! Also- My shipping box was damaged but well-packed but with no ice pack. They sent it to South Texas-it's always warm here! When the box was opened, I found the truffles' box itself was damaged. This is a really sturdy box. Made out of bookbinding or some other hard, thick card material. The shipping company must have really been slamming it around. Well, it is Christmastime....."}
