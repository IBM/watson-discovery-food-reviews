I love that they are microwaveable and quick to make when I'm having a snack attack!  I haven't had any problems with them puffing up as other reviewers have had, but I sprinkle mine with a little bit of vinegar (I have an undying love of salt n vinegar chips) and they puff right up.  If you're not a vinegar person, try wiping them with a damp paper towel or sprinkling water on them first.  I've found the two minute cook time to be true to form even though I don't cook as many as they say a serving is on the package. It is also true that they crunch up more if you let them sit for a few minutes after coking (and listening to them still snap crackle and pop is fun too!)  I think I'm going to try using some other flavorings on them soon as well.. maybe some ranch seasoning sprinkled on there?"}
