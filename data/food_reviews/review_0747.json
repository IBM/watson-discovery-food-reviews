Ever wish that your favorite buttery popcorn was just a little better for you? The answer is here. Grandpa Po's Orginals, innovative snack made from organic soybeans,comes in Slightly Unsalted and Slightly Spicy.<br /><br /> Our family & friends love this terrifc snack. What a bonus that it is also organic and good for us! I can eat the whole bag all by myself & have! Our 4 kids & their friends love them too. We have been requested to only bring Grandpa Po's Nutra Nuts for our snack turn at Girl Scouts, Confrimation, and for the tennis team. We have been so lucky to have been able to enjoy them for years! Thank you! Betsy from NJ"}
