That is a HUGE difference. Shop around - you can find saffron from several retailers for $85-$95 per ounce, thus making this .03 total ounces valued at $2.70. I know this is an awesome spice at a ridiculous price (no matter where you order it from), but a diligent consumer will save alot. It will also be beneficial to learn what to look for in high quality saffron vs. low quality. Happy surfing!"}
