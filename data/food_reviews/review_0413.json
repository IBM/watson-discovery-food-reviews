It is not coffee, it is a coffee DRINK, and it is darn good.  If you ever go to the grocery store and purchase a cappuccino drink that is ready to go and you just have to add hot water, this is<br />similar, and it is good!!!  You could add a little whipped milk on the top if you want, but you don't have to!!  I am very happy with this product!!!"}
