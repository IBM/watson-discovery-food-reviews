I've been trying this organic Rishi tea for two weeks now and have experimented with different amounts of tea to get the flavor right and have not been able to. It is just okay for me. This tea is advertised as a bold tea and I see that many reviewers agree but I do not.  If I add too much tea to try to make it stronger it adversely affects the taste unlike other loose teas I use.  Also, this tea requires 1 TBL of dry tea per 8oz of water; I need to use twice that amount for it not to be weak, whereas other loose teas I use only require 1 1/2 tsp. for the same strength, so this Rishi tea would be much more expensive to use regularly.  I may prepare it occasionally just to have a change once in awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful.  It is packed in a very nice earthy looking tin and is slender and tall so fits in the cabinet nicely.  The big plus with this tea is that it's organic."}
