I ordered a case of it from Amazon.  the whole case arrived moldy.  Each jar popped when I opened it too, showing that it was properly sealed.  I contacted Earth's Best.  They said they would look into it but would not follow up with me.  Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE:  I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth's Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.  They have come to my house and written a report.  If anyone else noticed this problem please contact the USDA (1-888-674-6854).<br />to report your claim/problem.  They will investigate the problem and the Earth's Best Plant to make sure they are following regulations."}
