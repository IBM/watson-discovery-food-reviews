Whatever the claims, this mix has no chocolate flavor of any kind. A more correct description would be Coconut flavored drink mix. Apparently the 10 oz rating is including the weight of the \"cauldron\" because there's no way there was 10 oz of product inside. You might get three cups of \"hot chocolate\" per container if you like the \"flavor\" really mild.<br />It really wasn't worth the price I paid and certainly not the inflated regular price. Two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those won't even be much use as decoration. Look for a better brand."}
