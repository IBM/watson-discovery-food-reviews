But Organic!","Text":"I received my order with a few problems. The majority of the cans arrived dented, some very severely! Amazon needs to add better packing material to keep the cans from moving around in the shipping box, I am surprised they haven't fixed this shipping issue by now because of all the complaints here in the reviews. However, Amazon is really great when it comes to problems like this with food items...they are shipping me a new order, no charge, and I get to keep my original order! I am hoping my new order arrives in better condition! These San Marzano Tomatoes are not \"DOP Certified\"! Even though the description says they are? Many people have complained about this in the reviews so I am surprised Amazon is still listing them as \"DOP Certified\"? However, they are very good quality tomatoes and Certified Organic. I have also noticed the price of this item fluctuates often so here's a tip...place it in your shopping cart and then save it for later, check your cart daily and wait for the price to drop! I paid $20.79 but I have seen the price as high as $53.00, so it pays to be patient. Good luck!"}
