If you enjoyed their age-old flavor don't fill the bowl all the way to the top.<br /><br />The second difference is that these bowls no longer insulate, so please be careful after adding boiling water.  WARNING: they are hot.  It's a design flaw in order to make the bowls recyclable/microwavable.<br /><br />The tradeoff is that they can be microwaved now.  The lids are different as well.  They don't have the same lining as before, but create a nice seal if you simply place a spoon over them for the three minutes after adding boiling water.<br /><br />I have yet to microwave a batch--it seems useless if you have a stove, so just be aware of the new design next time you go to enjoy a bowl."}
