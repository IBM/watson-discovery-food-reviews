It is perfectly easy but I have had nothing but problems from mine. There is a constant popping in anything I record.  I am using an AKG C3000B microphone I have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic.  Anyone else having this problem? Haven't been in touch with tech support yet, but I will say I am not happy with the Icicle. . ."}
