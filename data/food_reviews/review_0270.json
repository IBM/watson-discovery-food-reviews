Despite being sugar free it has 15 calories per pump and in my opinion needs three pumps to add enough flavor to my iced vanilla lattes. If your going for calorie count this isn't favorable. I would however say if you think other brands are a bit too sweet or if calorie count isn't overly important you should give it a go, it may be just what you were looking for! As a side note if calorie count is unimportant I recommend their coconut cream flavor<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZU3JJ4\">Amoretti Premium Coconut Cream Syrup (750mL)</a>, its delicious!"}
