I had read the good and bad reviews and decided it was worth trying the Fog Chaser. Well, I loved it! My cup was as bold and rich as traditional plastic K-cups and better than the reuseable cups (My K-cup, Ekobrew). This will be a mainstay in my coffee selection due to the flavor and affordability. I highly recommend trying it.<br /><br />Hopefully, someone can comment on whether these will work for the new Keurig Vue machine."}
