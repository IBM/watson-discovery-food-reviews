The can is very small, about the size of a Red Bull. The drink is said to be 100% juice carbonated, with no sugar added, no preservatives, no corn syrup, no artificial colors and gluten free.<br /><br />Each can has 135 calories, 15mg of sodium, 34g of carbs and 33g of sugar. On Amazon, the price comes out to about $1 per can.<br /><br />I like the fact that Switch is all natural, but the sugar content is still quite high (I believe a 12oz can of coke has 40g of sugar). Calories are not to be ignored either. The taste was OK, but not fantastic by any means - very sugary, not enough carbonation. In fact, the Kiwi Berry flavor did remind me of Red Bull as well, which I do not particularly enjoy. I think I'll stick to unsweetened iced tea..."}
