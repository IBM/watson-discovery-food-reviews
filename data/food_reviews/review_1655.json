It is produced about 40 or 50 miles away from where I live, and they source only local ingredients, nothing comes from China.  So it is a food I feel very comfortable with, I know that this company cares about my pet's health and takes it seriously.  And it is very reasonably priced at one of my local pet food stores.  Now, there are those who would point to the oats and vegetables and declare it unacceptable.  But my cat never throws up or has diarrhea with Eagle Pack.  He seems to do best on the Lamb variety and the Duck variety.  The Turkey one gave him slightly softer stools for some reason.  I think the price and quality make us both happy, for now.  I'd love to feed him the optimal diet (probably raw) but I still have some reservations about it that I would have to come to terms with, so for now, we're sticking with this."}
