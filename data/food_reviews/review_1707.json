But I'm happy with the quality and taste.  I found a recipe online on how to make sticky rice with mango (I always crave this dessert when we go to Thai restaurants) and it was easy peasy with this rice.  Just put a cup of rice in a bowl, add enough water to go 10% above the rice line, cover with a dish, stick in microwave for 3 minutes, remove & mix, microwave again for 3 minutes, remove & mix, continue to microwave for 3 minutes until the rice becomes translucent.  Voila!  Perfect sticky rice.  To make the coconut sauce, just boil coconut milk and add some sugar to taste (I use honey).  Pour over sticky rice and add mango.  I will never order sticky rice with mango at a restaurant again!"}
