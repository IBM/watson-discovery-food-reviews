Because I have Amazon Prime the cost per bag is really good as far as a reseller goes. Each flavor is really good in its own right. These chips the Asian Sweet and Spicy are just so tasty. Its just the right amount of sweet and the slightest bit of spice that makes these a fantastic tasting chip.<br /><br />Lets talk about details:<br /><br />Chip thickness (+)<br />These are gourmet chips and the quality is there from the moment you open the bag. Each one is crunchy and not too thick but just enough to let you know you didn't buy a bag of Lays.<br /><br />Grease (+)<br />These are NOT greasy chips. Depending on the flavor they are just mildy seasoned and not coated in a heavy grease or oil.<br /><br />Flavor (+)<br />Each flavor stands completely on its own. You could do a blind taste test of each one of these flavors sold by Deep River and I bet you could tell what it was. None of the flavors are overpowering except maybe the Jalapeno flavor which is honestly too hot and I love hot food.<br /><br />Resale (+)<br />You may not resell these but at the current price and using Prime shipping the cost per bag allows you to make a decent profit.<br /><br />Overall:<br />These are great tasting, unique flavored chips that are hands down better than the ones you can get in bulk at a Sams or BJ's. Do yourself a favor and try a bag or two. I bet you'll love em like we do.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review."}
