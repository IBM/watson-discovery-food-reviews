This tea does not taste like an oolong tea.  I'm sure if they say it's oolong, then it probably is an oolong, but it really tastes more like a green tea.  It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.<br /><br />The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.  Some of them even bloom upside down.  Don't expect perfection and you'll be pleased with it."}
