They have a great balance of sweetness and spice. Of course, Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty. I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me - I don't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness. If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips."}
