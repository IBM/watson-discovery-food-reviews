It is essentially carbonated fruit juice with no added sweeteners.  I do agree that if you are a person who drinks a lot of soda or have  child who does, switching to his would be the better alternative.<br />BUT - this drink is not healthy by any means, the amount of fruit juice required for it's tastiness results in a HIGH sugar and calorie content for a fruit juice.  You would not want to drink 5 of these in a day and the better option would be a piece of fruit with less calories and sugar."}
