Ummm ... no.","Text":"I was looking forward to tasting the Switch Orange Tangerine drink since orange and tangerine flavors are two of my favorite but I was disappointed in the result.<br /><br />It was tangy. It tasted of ascorbic acid. It smelled of orange candy. It reminded me of breakfast. It reminded me of, yes, powdered Tang mixed with carbonated water followed by a strong unpleasant artificial aftertaste.  I found the the drink to be, simply, not very good.<br /><br />I tried to like the beverage and I did appreciate the concept but considering the unusual flavors, high calorie count of 140 cals/8.5 oz, and cost of almost a dollar/serving -- I cannot recommend Switch."}
