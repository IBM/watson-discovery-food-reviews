However, keep in mind you cannot use your normal k-cup \"display\" set up that most of you have.  You must keep these k-cups sealed in an airtight container to keep them fresh, as they do not have the plastic housing you are use to.  Perhaps this is why the coffee actually tastes like coffee.  Stick to the Foghouse blend - it's stronger and richer tasting than the other.  The cost is less, most likely because the plastic is missing.  You have a normal coffee filter-type-fabric encasing the coffee. Looks different than your normal k-cup, but tastes soooo much better.  I'm glad I read a review and purchased this product.  Hope you do too."}
