I also like that it takes up less storage space than those carousels plus a machine.  I have limited counter top space and it is already crowded.<br />A minor issue, as I had read before, was that the added height to the machine causes lid to hit the cupboards while opening and closing. I am OK with pulling it away from the wall a bit and will eventually place my machine in a more open counter space to avoid this.  It does bother my husband more though.<br />I was disappointed with the product a bit.  My main problem was the material on the top of the drawer, that you rest the machine on, was not done very aesthetically.  AS soon as I opened what stood out to me was that it had to have been hand cut, and was cut slightly wrong on my product.  First I can still see the pencil mark all across the front.  Then it was cut too short and  coroner was not cut squarely.  It happens to h ave also been across the front edge of my product so it just sticks out to me and lessens it's appeal.<br />I find the drawer to operate smoothly and easily.  you can not reach the back row of K-cups while full but that is not a big deal to me at all."}
