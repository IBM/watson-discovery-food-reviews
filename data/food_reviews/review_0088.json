The bar is half the size you think it is going to be...It is literally a two-bite bar.  Very deceptive advertising.  That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star.  My 10 year old son ate one and didn't like them. I ate one and agreed as did my husband.  Couldn't give it away!  Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I'm concerned."}
