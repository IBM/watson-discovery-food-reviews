I have been in search of the perfect sugar-free treat for years and I may have found it!  These licorice flavored candies pack a great flavor punch - remind me of chewing on black licorice jelly beans as a kid.  The texture is a bit too grainy but there is no weird aspartame-type aftertaste to them so I can overlook the grain.  Just be conscious of the warning on the label and limit yourself to 4!"}
