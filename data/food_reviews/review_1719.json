To name a few: Pumpkin Ice Cream, Pumpkin Bread and Muffins, Pumpkin Pie, Pumpkin Spice Latte (coffee), Pumpkin Cheesecake, etc. etc.  I recently started adding canned pumpkin to our Sunday morning pancakes, and was delighted with the results; however, I wanted a stronger pumpkin taste/flavor.  I found this product and excitedly ordered two bottles.  It arrived very quickly (within 3 days), and I just tried it this morning in our pancakes.  The flavor DOES NOT taste like pumpkin whatsoever.  It tastes like a chemical and leaves a bad taste in my mouth, literally.  I dumped both bottles down the sink and had to throw away the pancakes.  I was not able to eat them, they were terrible.  I was actually nauseated after trying to eat them.  I'm not a picky eater and have no allergies whatsoever.  I'm the type of person that will eat nearly everything, and cannot think of any food that I don't like.  I'm going to continue my search for a \"NATURAL\" TRUE pumpkin extract; however, this is definitely not it.  I hope this helps you, especially if you're as passionate about pumpkin flavor as I am. Happy Holidays to You and Yours.  Sincerely, Tim"}
