These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)"}
