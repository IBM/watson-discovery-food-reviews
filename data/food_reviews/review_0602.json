Shipping was fast and worry free. I really like the fact that this comes packed in 10 individual packs of 8 k-cups each. The reason for this is that these k-cups are different in their construction. Each one is plastic at the top but filter for the lower 3/4 of the k-cup. At first I thought..oh no..I see a big mess coming, but to my great surprise, everything went perfectly. I like this design for two reasons, one..they are made with green practices in every way possible, and..two..they brew alot faster than the regular k-cups. The taste is great, bold and deep mellow flavor, this is my new coffee for sure."}
