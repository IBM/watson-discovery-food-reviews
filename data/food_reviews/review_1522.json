I'm fairly new to living the gluten free lifestyle, and I've often been surprised by how bad some gluten free products can be.  I've had good luck with Pamela's products so far.  I noticed several people didn't like Pamela's Coconut Whenever bars, but I loved them!<br /><br />I think the size is just right for a snack, and they are moist and chewy.  The coconut flavor seemed authentic to me, not artificial.  There was just the right amount of chocolate to round out the flavor.  The chewy texture was just right as well, although every now and then I hit a piece of a hull or something that was unexpected.<br /><br />I've pretty much given up on most baked goods since giving up gluten.  I have no idea if I would like these bars as much if I were still able to eat 'regular' food.  Overall, I think they are very good for a gluten free product and it's something I'd like to have again."}
