BUT, contacted a few Keurig K-Cup authorized on-line  sellers and was told by all that Grove Square are NOT approved by Keurig and using them will void the warranty on your brewer. Was told they are a \"pirated\" product.  Upon inspection, I discovered that the content are powdered milk, sugar, artificial flavors and INSTANT COFFEE!  Not even real coffee. Not sure if I'll buy again but does taste like Cafe Vienna instant coffee products with the convenience of Keurig. All authorized on-line sellers cannot carry them due to contracts with Keurig. Guess, buy at your own risk."}
