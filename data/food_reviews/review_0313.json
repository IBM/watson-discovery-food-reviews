I love my Keurig, and I also love a good cup of coffee in the morning and the San Francisco Bay Coffee Company doesn't disappoint. Their coffee is just as flavorful, if not more, than the big brand coffee chains. I will definitely be buying more Fog Chaser and also trying some of their other coffees!"}
