It disappeared from every one of the Indian shops in the S.F. Bay area about 6 months ago.  The tin you see above sold for about $11.  This tea was one of the best kept secrets I know.  Now the only tea approaching ... and I mean it is not as good ... it is Peet's Darjeeling, at $10 for 1/4 lb. tin.  The only other alternative for Darjeeling is to go to some of the Persian groceries and find it there.  They sell a brand that apparently has lower-quality Darjeeling that appears to be imported from India into Iran, then sent to U.S.  You could probably find other ethnic stores that have the same kind of thing.  Does anyone have an explanation for what is going on?"}
