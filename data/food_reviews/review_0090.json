With the subscription, the price is fair","Text":"Both our twins love this one right from the start but it's not loaded with lentils (see ingredients below).  We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they're 10 months.  I'm glad they are eating something green because we couldn't get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at 7 months, but we got them to eat the peas later at 9 months.<br /><br />Their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and we've also tried sweet potato with cinnamon. They love all the fruit varieties.<br /><br />I'm glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein, although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredients.<br /><br />This one also has carrots and I've heard all babies like carrots.  I don't know if they would like it without the carrots.  I haven't seen this one - lentils and brown rice - in our local stores, so I'm glad to get it here. Along with some others, we get this one with the subscription.  Of course, with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and we're so busy that it's great to get these delivered.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent.  I've ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive broken.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 10% protein, 100% vitamin A, 4% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult."}
