Because of - I presume - the amount of meat required to make real jerky, this has been a difficult endeavor. Even product lines like Milo's Kitchen source jerky from China while making the rest of their products - the ones they can process with fillers - in the US. True Chews markets US-made jerky treats but the meat is processed with other ingredients into a jerky-shaped chew that doesn't much resemble actual jerky.<br /><br />Likewise, when I received these treats they were not what I expected. \"Jerky,\" to my mind, means plain, dried meat. I thought the other mentioned ingredients would be added as a coating for flavor, but I expected a largely unprocessed product. In fact it is a cubed, compressed product containing significant amounts of grains and other ingredients as filler. My dog liked them but for the price there are other treats he likes better.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations of a treat labeled \"jerky\" are out of line, but I know a lot of people besides me are looking for a US-made jerky treat, and in my opinion this isn't it. On to Blue Buffalo Wilderness jerky. It is several times more expensive but so far the only \"real\" US-made jerky I have found."}
