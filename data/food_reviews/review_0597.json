I generally drink the stronger K-cups (Emeril's, Jet Fuel, Kona, etc), and I find that these Fog Chaser pods compare very favorably. There is no bitter aftertaste, just smooth flavor. I have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup (I've had sediment from other K-Cups). I think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it, as it is a much stronger smell than you'll get from a box of K-Cups. It does smell like when you open a fresh bag/can of ground coffee, which is sort of refreshing after using K-Cups for 3 years. We've just finished the first bag of 12 (6 days), which we kept in a ziplock bag, and the last cup tasted as good as the first. I already placed a subscribe and save order for the French Roast to try out. I will be keeping my subscription for the Fog Chaser, as it is quite good."}
