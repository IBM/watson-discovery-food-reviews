I admit I was skeptical of some of the rave reviews.  Well the Snappy white popcorn arrived first so I tried it immediately.  I actually measured (I usually just eye-ball it) 3 T canola oil, 1/3 cup Snappy popcorn and 1/3 tsp Flavacol flavored salt.  I put the oil and Flavacol in my trusty Whirly-pop popper and swirled to distribute the Flavacol.  I then added the popcorn.  It popped REALLY quickly, snowy white and fluffy.  It was divine.  Tender, not greasy or chewy and so flavorful.  I will update this post when I try the other brands I ordered to let you know how it stacks up.  Oh, and I had ONE kernel that didn't pop!"}
