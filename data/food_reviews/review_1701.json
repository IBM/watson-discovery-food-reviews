And they use all vanilla and cocoa butter and whole milk powder. Hershey uses vanillin...which is a wood extract..I have a bag that was given to me, and all I do is snack on it, letting it melt on my tongue to taste the almost orgasmic caramel flavor that stays with you for like ten minutes after eating it. Which ever chocolate you eat, let it melt on your tongue first instead of chomping on it. One, you eat less, and two, you appreciate it, and three, you can taste all the flavors."}
