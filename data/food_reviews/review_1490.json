In fact, if you drop the dough on the cookie sheet and don't flatten it a little, you will end up with cookie mounds.  Uneven edges around each cookie will remain so -- these do not flatten out into smooth-edged discs.  The texture reminds me of homemade oatmeal cookies, actually.<br /><br />I realized after the first batch I didn't even need to butter the cookie sheet. I use aluminum bakeware yet the finished cookies came off the un-buttered sheets as if they had a non-stick coating (they don't).  I typically baked the cookies for about 14 minutes and they were soft and moist but set.  At 15 min. they were still soft, not quite as moist but not dry.<br /><br />Second, I admit I wasn't sure I liked the taste much at first. The one thing I could definitely pinpoint about the taste after the first batch was that they seemed too salty.  So for all subsequent batches I used unsalted butter and this was a big improvement.  These do not taste the same as non-GF cookies, IMO, yet they are pretty good (very good with milk) and for me they did satisfy chocolate-chip-cookie cravings**.<br /><br />**These cookies have far more chocolate chips/chunks than I find in typical cookie mixes, which helps with my evaluation, I'm sure. :)"}
