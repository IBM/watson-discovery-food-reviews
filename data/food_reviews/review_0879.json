My two girls loved it. We used to put some in their Kongs, then put in dry food and then seal the end with more wet food and put it in the freezer so that dinner would become more of a challenge. The only con with this food is that it can be pricey, as are most Wellness products. You could probably get the same results you're looking for from a grain free food with something like Taste of the Wild, which is what we've gone to because of cost."}
