Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill.  I've had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty.  I've served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them. It's also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic...but I would eat them anyway."}
