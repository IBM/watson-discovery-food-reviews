When I make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich it is usually an inch thick.  I LOOOOVE peanut butter, so much so that I do not have in the house because I know that i will end up eating the whole jar.  Well I ordered PB2 not expecting much, but WOOWW I was blown away.  It tastes exactly like peanut butter. IT lives up to all the reviews.  If they have it in a bigger size I will be ordering it or maybe in multiple jars. I mixed it and put in the Arctic Zero Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor and I swear I almost cried, it was so good.  It was like omg. I could have a pint of chocolate peanut butter ice cream for only 240 calories.  I could have my favorite treat every day and still fit into my size 8 jeans.  Glory, Glory!!!"}
