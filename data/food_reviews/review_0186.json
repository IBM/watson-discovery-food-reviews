First of all .8 oz. per bag equals about 15 or 16 chips per bag, which is not many. While this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories, fat or sodium, the fact is that .8 of an ounce is not much, and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time.  Due to the discounted price each bag was around $.55 each, not to bad until you figure that equals $10 per pound. At the regular price its about $16 per pound. As far as the taste, all of the flavors were good, none that I absolutely disliked, but none that really rocked my socks either. Bottom line, at the discounted price I paid I was not disappointed, but if I had paid the regular price for these I would have felt cheated."}
