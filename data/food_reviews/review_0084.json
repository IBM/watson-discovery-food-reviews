I have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and I never get tired of it.  It's an excellent morning tea, is smooth without being insipid, and is almost impossible to ruin by oversteeping. Just use decent water.  I like a little stevia in it, as I'm a wimp. It brings out the natural sweetness of its malty, slightly floral style.  I just bought another two pounds."}
