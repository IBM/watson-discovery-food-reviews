Previously, donut shop or caribou kcups were our favorite. Those are both great, we still love them. I ordered the sfbay french roast, as was definitely intrigued. It had a bold taste, and the cups themselves got my attention. I wish the top cap wasn't plastic, but the pouch definitely allows for more of that coffee smell that I missed when moving to the keurig. I decided to try fog chaser out, it's fantastic. The flavor is wonderful, smells great while you're brewing, and we cut the tops off and easily compost the rest. It's a step in the right direction, and I would recommend these to anyone with a keurig."}
