I received a sample and it sat in the fridge for a good week before I was brave enough to give it a taste.<br /><br />At first sip, it was much sweeter than I expected it to be. I could certainly taste the pineapple, but the coconut flavor was much more pronounced than I thought it would be. It was good! I very much enjoyed the taste of the drink. It was exotic and refreshing. It was much fuller in weight, as I was thinking it would be watery with a mild flavor.<br /><br />The box reminded me of those chocolate milks that I buy for my kids, but it didn't detract from the flavor."}
