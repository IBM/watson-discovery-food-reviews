I have Intercystial Cyctitis, which is inflammation of the bladder, and since I started drinking ZICO, my symptoms have vanished.  I absolutely LOVE the chocolate flavor...coconut and chocolate are the BEST combination.  I drink about 4 bottles a day and it keeps me feeling wonderful.  I've shopped around, and Amazon.com has the lowest price I've found, which enables me to buy more, which is GREAT!"}
