I opened the first can from this order, and the tomatoes weren't very good at all - nothing like I was used to. I later noticed that the can does not have the \"D.O.P. Certified\" label, like the photo on the Amazon page does. These tomatoes are not D.O.P. certified, and are not real San Marzano tomatoes. They are a cheap imitation.  The seller tried to mimic the label of real san marzano tomatoes so they could sell them for a higher price. I would recommend you stay away from these.  You can get better tomatoes for a fourth the price at your local grocery store."}
