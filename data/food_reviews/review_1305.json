If you make muffins, the instructions advise that you will get 6-8. Not on this planet. It takes 2 packages to get that. Not such a great $$ deal after all. In addition, it calls for 2/3 cup water or milk. That makes soup. You need maybe half that to get a proper batter consistency. Two stars off for all that.<br /><br />As far as flavor goes...it's exactly as expected. A fair amount of corn-ness, not sweet. I added an egg (there's no obvious binder in the ingredient list) and about a tablespoon of sugar to two packages, and cut back on the milk by roughly half. They rose and browned nicely, and had great texture.<br /><br />While these were fine from a flavor and convenience perspective, I would not buy again, unless the price was drastically lower. Too much money for a too-small bag of cornmeal and baking powder."}
