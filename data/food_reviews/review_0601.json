These are not K-cups, but dowill fit in your machine. I thought I had ordered the wrong product at first. These simply have a plastic ring at the top so that they'll fit in your K-cup holder and the rest of it is like a standard coffee filter. I've only tried Fog Chaser (ordered all 3 flavors) and was surprised that I liked the coffee. However, because it's using a filter rather than the K-cup technology, it does leave a sediment in the bottom of your cup. I find this also happens when using the My K-Cup filter with whatever brand of coffee I use.<br /><br />You will need to store the \"k-cups\" in a ziploc to keep them fresh. The 36-count come packaged in 3 plastic bags of 12 each. This is nice so that you only have to open up one 12 pack at a time so the others can stay fresh.<br /><br />I'm mostly neutral, but lean more toward \"would buy again\"."}
