The mesh cups are great, the flavor bold and rich. I should have stuck with the French Roast.  I was sadly dissapointed in Fogchaser. It was actually bland, nothing bold about it.  Either there was something wrong with the coffee or it is just plain weak.  I will reorder the French Roast and give the other 46 cups of Fogchaser to my 87 year old Father-in-law who likes his coffee mild."}
