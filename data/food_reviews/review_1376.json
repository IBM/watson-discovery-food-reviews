I really like it as a snack. It's sweet but with a little kick to it.  I've been buying the 7.06 oz five packs and freezing them until I use them.  Today I saw that it's available for a regularly scheduled subscription (at a discounted rate and with no shipping charges) and I am ecstatic.  This is just a great snack if you want something sweet with just a little bit of heat."}
