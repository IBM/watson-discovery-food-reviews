I started about 20 plants indoors in the winter, all from seeds. I did not have the gnat or worm problems that others have wrote about so I am wondering if that is a problem with only bags bought online (for whatever reason). Anyways, I started a bunch of hanging spider pants, tomato plants, peppers, and corn. All grew excellent from seeds. However I had no luck trying to start an apple tree, which I tried to do several times from seeds. I also found that once your plant is established you should add some regular top soil to this potting mix. I kept the plants growing in the same mix for over 2 years, until they just outgrew their small pots. The soil did well. I plan on using it again."}
