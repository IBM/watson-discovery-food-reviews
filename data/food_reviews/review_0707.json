My wife and I thought we would give them a try.  They are pretty easy to use.  The thing we don't like is the mess they make in the machine.  Even when to top is secure, they leak into the machine. You have to keep cleaning the filter basket or it gets sticky.  I would advise you to use something better like the E-Z Cup."}
