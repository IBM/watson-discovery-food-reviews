I've been looking for a blend that I could use as my standard every-day cup of coffee and, finally, this was it.  I've tried so many of the other blends and brands and they were either harsh and bitter (I know, some people think coffee *should* taste that way!) or too bland and weak. This is smooth but with a nice \"coffee\" presence you can actually taste.  *Coffee* taste, not burned grounds!<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you're *not* into the \"make your hair stand on end\" type of coffee. This review is based on using the \"medium\" size on the coffee machine.  You may get different results if you use the small or large dispenser sizes."}
