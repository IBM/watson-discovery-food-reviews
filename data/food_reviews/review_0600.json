Yes please!","text":"These do not look like regular K-cups. And perhaps they won't keep as long because the bottom looks like it's made of rounded cloth, kind of like a tea bag. But they fit Keurig machines just fine, are less expensive, and most importantly I think this coffee tastes better than the coffee in plastic K-cups. I actually prefer the fact that the bottom is not made of plastic. I never liked the idea that my hot coffee was being strained through a plastic cup. In fact, I just ordered more."}
