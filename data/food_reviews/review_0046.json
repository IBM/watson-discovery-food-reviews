It is a little weird to review potato chips.  But these chips are great. The crunch is just right, plus they have just the right amount of salt. Not to salty not too bland. They are a little oily but that's ok. The best thing is the 2 oz package. When I buy a larger bag it's harder to resist eating them all.  This 2 oz package allows for a little \"portion control\". Be sure to use your scissors to open, 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and don't open easily. Enjoy!"}
