I enjoyed the coffee, had great aroma and love that it's packaging is reduced plastic compared to original Kcups. The main thing I loved was the price! Just figure out a way to retain freshness and it's gold!<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA84\">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Fog Chaser, 36-Count</a>"}
