I am a dog trainer and have never seen  anything like it....<br /><br />three weeks later,, the beloved sheltie got a bowel blockage from these, use with caution.<br />if the cat gets too many she has the runs....<br />sheltie did better when i upped her thryoid meds, and gave her doggie asthma meds.<br />so it worked better for the 18 year old cat, who also has asthma."}
