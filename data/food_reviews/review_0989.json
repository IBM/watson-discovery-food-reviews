The seller gave early warning before shipping stating the weather had been abnormally hot and that they could not be held responsible for packages missed and left to sit in the heat.  I assumed that was not an issue considering my wife was at their home and aware the package would be arriving and I had also purchased priority shipping (additional $8+dollars).  No such luck.  Be sure whoever you are buying these from gives you absolute specifics before you buy.<br />Just to be fair, I have to say the seller was very quick and courteous with responses to my concerns.  Unfortunately she didn't even consider any form of compensation though.  I really hate throwing money away and giving a less than memorable gift at the same time."}
