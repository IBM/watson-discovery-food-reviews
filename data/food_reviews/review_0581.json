Full body and full taste just like it came ground fresh....and no, i don't know or work for the company, just thought you would like an honest review from someone that buys 6-8 boxes of K-cup coffee a month.<br />I noticed NO sediment in my cup and yes they cut the corner by leaving off the pastic cup to avoid the copyright that says they would then owe Kuerig a percentage....which drives up the price of all coffe in K-cups. IT'S NOT A K-CUP, BUT WILL FIT A K CUP MAKER, and that is what they advertise.<br /><br />I can live with putting the filter cups in a baggie. I don't need to show off my coffee in a carousel, so this is just great to get a \"subscription discount\" for this good of a coffee that will fit my k-cup brewer."}
