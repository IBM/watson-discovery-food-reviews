Well, that used to be true.  Now I know a little something about them that I'd like to share with you.  I was a typical person... I bought olive oil at my local grocery store but I didn't really know anything about it.  In time I learned about cold-pressed olive oil being preferred.  Next i learned a little more about the deeper concepts of olive oil.  I sampled various relatively expensive domestic brands, the kinds available at my local Harris Teeter.  But my experiences weren't very fruitful.  I simply wasn't moved.  Until I decided to give in to a wild hare and order a foreign bottle of olive oil.  And WOW!  What a difference!! Such a fruitful nose and a beautiful color.  I never knew it could be like this.  I simply didn't have a clue that this could exist.  But what I ordered was fairly expensive.  At least compared to what I could get locally.  THIS PARTICULAR olive oil was my second foree into non-domestic samples.  And not only is it better than the first REAL olive oil I tried, it's cheaper.  If you choose this olive oil you're going to pay about 30% more than what you can get locally.  With shipping costs and all.  (Minus sales tax, yay!)  But this olive oil is very high quality.  And although it costs a tad bit more that what you can buy locally, the lift in quality makes it worth it ten times over.<br /><br />I just ordered my second bottle and I see this as being something I do every 3 or 4 months."}
