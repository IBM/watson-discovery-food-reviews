Both are good products. I do like the see through container this one has though a bit better since you can see exactly how much you have left a little easier. I use the oil for my GI tract since I have several issues with it and have difficulty with handling and absorbing fats. I try to eat at least a tblsp a day, usually spread on toast, it's excellent as a spread. I use it in baking in place of butter and other oils and sometimes for cooking too."}
