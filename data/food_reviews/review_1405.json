I did lie on this review; I am 12 years old not 13, so that may disqualify me but I am the one that ate Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats.  As a west highland terrier, needless to say, I am very fussy and rather demanding.  I am well loved and my \"masters\" will buy me almost anything.  This treat is perfect for me since I cannot eat anything that has grains.  All my food must be wheat free.  I had cancer a few years ago and my miracle Vet told me that the other food encourges cancer growth.  Therefore, I am a protein addict and often get hamburger, fish, chicken prepared for humans.  Now that's a treat.<br /><br />I was given these treats and I noticed my \"father\" broke it in half.  He thought it would be too much for me.  I thought I could handle it, but the cookie took some effort to break down.  I finished it and asked for more.  I know they will buy it for me because it has the ingredients I can eat and they trust Newman's product development and manufacturing.  All my food is expensive so the price will not be a factor.  I am grateful there are good tasting grain-free treats for me, and this one passes my sniffing and palate tests. Now that you know me, you can call me Augie."}
