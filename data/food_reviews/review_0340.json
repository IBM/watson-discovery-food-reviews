These ecocups produce a nice cup of medium strength coffee (not as strong as a regular Kcup). I use the Fog Chase and French Roast on the 12 ounce setting but the Rainforest is too weak to use  so I have to use the 8 ounce setting. The Big plus with these ecocups is that they are really good for use with your own coffee! I use DisposaCup Lids to refill these ecocups over and over again! That's a great vaule at 38 cents a \"Kcup\"!! <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NM9YW6\">DisposaCup Lids - 100 Disposable Replacement Lids for Use with Any Keurig K-cup - BOX of 100 LIDS</a>"}
