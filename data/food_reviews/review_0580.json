Having said that, in my experience it is a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer.  I received an order of three 36 count boxes.  The 36 count boxes were unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon.  See the customer image I uploaded.  Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods.  I also have uploaded an image of a pod next to a K-cup for comparison.  The bags are not resealable!  You will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness.  I have found the pods work just as well as a normal K-cup.  I have no complaints about their function.<br /><br />About the coffee:  It is a very strong bold blend.  I think it tastes great, but it is too strong for my wife's taste!  If you like making a bigger cup (running water through the pod twice) it does a great job.  I definitely recommend this if you like strong coffee!"}
