We found a food that was OK for her but she didn't really like it.  I just bought a small bag of this and gave it to her and she really seems to love it!  I'm glad Natural Balance keeps making options for dogs with food issues.  I couldn't find a lot of feedback on this yet as it's new, so I wanted to write this L.I.D. review so people with dogs like my Mom's would know that this one is a winner!"}
