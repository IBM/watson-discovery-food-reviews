It is a bit darker of a roast than some of the other mediums out in Keurig-land, but it isn't bitter.  There's just a little of something chocolatey in the flavor.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this coffee, like most of the Keurig cups that don't say \"extra bold\" on them, they brew up pretty weak if you do a larger mug.  I typically brew the 9.25 oz size, and on these guys I bumped it down to the 7.25 oz size.  If I brew it in the larger cups, it just comes out too weak.<br /><br />If you are one who feels that K-cups usually make weak coffee, you will think that these are really weak, and be tempted to brew 'em two at a time.  This coffee is not plain or unflavorvful -- there's just less coffee in the K-cup (or rather the normal, not extra-bold amount), so it brews up weaker."}
