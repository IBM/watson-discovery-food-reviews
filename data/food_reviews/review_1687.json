Nutritionally, the drink contains more sugar and calories than an equivalent 8 oz serving of soda or iced tea, but these seem in-line with other juice beverages. This drink makes me curious why Snapple didn't branch into carbonated fruit beverages, but perhaps the reason may have something to do with cost. It is difficult to select this beverage when it costs two to three times more than soda or canned iced tea; however, I would buy a case of mixed flavors, if such an SKU became available, for entertaining purposes."}
