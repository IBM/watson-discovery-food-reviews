This was the most bland chowder I've ever had.  I prepared it with just milk and a little butter, and it tasted like nothing!  Added some salt and white pepper, still nothing.  Added some black pepper and Provence herbs, now it tastes like herbed potato soup.<br /><br />On the plus side the clams were nice big chunks and the potatoes were tender.  The consistency was pretty good too.  It just had no flavor.  Not going to be buying this again, certainly not when it's this expensive, too."}
