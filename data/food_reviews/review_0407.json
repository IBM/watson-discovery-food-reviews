Although Vista was a little confusing, nothing more was involved than finding the right audio preferences.  No drivers in either case.  I recorded a short review of the Blue FOR each setup, WITH each setup, which I posted on my devnotes posterous com blog -- you can search that out and listen to both of them if you have any doubts about the sound.  The whole thing lights up blue when it's plugged in, so if you love blue, this mic's for you.  I have a Behringer condenser mic, about the least expensive mic you can find, but it sounded great before and it sounds great through the blue icicle."}
