I specifically ordered a plant on the internet to avoid getting one of these.<br /><br />I still give 4 stars because it did arrive in pretty good shape, and most of the plants like this in stores are not very healthy. And, after all, I ordered a flytrap in a 3\" pot and that's what I got. Just know that if you have a local store with a garden center, they may have these plants already and you could save the shipping cost by buying one there if you can find one in decent shape."}
