Two of my favorite things!","Text":"I could not wait to get my tea in the mail!  My favorite type of tea is Oolong for it's fruity, sweet flavor.  And then add peach to this?!  AWESOME!  What a great blend!  I think the peach may be a little too over powering of the Oolong, but I still love this tea.  Not to mention, it's fresh.  You can always tell if tea is too old.  This tea was really really fresh.<br /><br />Loose leaf tea is usually pricey, and Oolong is even pricer.  I usually can only afford 2 or 4 oz at a time.  But this tea is a HUGE bargain!  I feel like I got a huge deal.  I opened the sealed bag (also comes with a resealable ziplock just inside) and was so surprised by how much tea is in here.  This is going to last me a long time - yay!  It says it's 8 ounces, but looking at it, it seems like it's more like 12 ounces.  Maybe it's my imagination?<br /><br />This is my first time buying Boston Tea, but I don't think it will be my last.  I'm excited to try more teas by them."}
