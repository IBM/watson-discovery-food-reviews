If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!"}
