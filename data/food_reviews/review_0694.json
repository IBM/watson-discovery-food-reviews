It's 100% juice with no added sugar, so even though the sugar content is a little high, it has more nutrients than soda will have any day.  Switch tastes like tangy, carbonated orange drink, and that's fine with me!  I didn't notice any aftertaste, and I could feel safe drinking something fizzy (and tasty, unlike sparkling water) without feeling guilty about it.  But beware - each can is only 8.3 ounces, a little more than a cup.  You decide if it's worth it."}
