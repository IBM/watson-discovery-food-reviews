I use it as a morning oatmeal mix-in and have been very pleased. It adds a vaguely sweet/nutty, chocolate taste (though not EXACTLY like \"cocoa,\" which might irk some people with the wrong expectations) and a good amount of protein and fiber to boot. I also like to use it in baking that could use a chocolate-y hint (and discreet nutritional benefits) without adding too much bulk. Natural ingredients, fair-trade certified, low-calorie, lots of protein and fiber, tastes good -- what more could you want? (Warning, though: do not, \"for the heck of it,\" try to eat a spoon of this stuff out of the canister! Ha! A friend of mine made that mistake and remarked its texture/dryness (not flavor) as similar to eating straight baby powder. Does not dissolve easily on tongue.)"}
