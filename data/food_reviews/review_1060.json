Base tastes like regular tomato soup. Better than Campbell's tomato soup, I would say. There are vegetables mixed in: corn, green beans, and carrots. Green beans and carrots basically turn to mush in my mouth, and I can barely taste them. Corn isn't mushy, but doesn't taste sweet. I suspect this has something to do with being canned in a tomato base. Alphabet noodles have a nice texture. Smooth, and not too mushy.<br /><br />I love this soup. Very satisfying for something that is fat-free. Will re-purchase many times. I'm sure this would also make excellent kids' food."}
