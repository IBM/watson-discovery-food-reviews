After trying this tea, to my surprise and delight I may have found another favorite!<br /><br />This tea is very smooth with low acidity and it goes a long way. This is a loose tea and it brews up wonderfully in the Bodum double wall infuser cup. You can make several cups of tea with just a heaping teaspoon of this loose tea and each cup tastes great without being weak.<br /><br />The lemony bergomot is a lovely subtle addition that tastes and smells wonderful. The tea has a beautiful dark amber color and a full rounded flavor without the acidic bite some tea can have.<br /><br />At first the price seemed a bit high but after using it and seeing how little you actually need to use I would recommend this highly as a great value and consider it for gift giving. Then again once you try it you may not want to give it away. Very enjoyable tea!"}
