When we went in for our 12 month tooth-cleaning appointment, the vet told us to take her home as her teeth didn't need any cleaning for another 6 months, at least.  It is specially designed for their teeth and health needs, and she loves it.  And it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store!  What more could you ask?"}
