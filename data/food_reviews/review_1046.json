Caramel apple pops fit the bill perfectly: 60 calories, and they last long enough to satisfy my sweet tooth!<br /><br />I went looking for these in local grocery stores and couldn't find them, but luckily Amazon saved the day. The pops came in the packaging that is shown in the picture but (as another reviewer pointed out) they look like they were home made. The pops vary in size, shape and mixture. However, it didn't really bother me and unless you NEED perfectly shaped pops with just the right combination of caramel and hard candy, I doubt it will bother you either.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended! Just wish stores would start carrying these again!<br /><br />BTW, here's the nutrition information in case you want it:<br />Calories - 60, Total Fat - 1g, Sodium - 15mg, Total Carbs - 15g, Sugars - 10g, Calcium - 2%"}
