You'll know them by their skin and ear issues.  While most dog treats remind me of beef jerky, these actually remind me of wheat granola bars.  They are medium sized bars that are scored in the middle so you can break them in half.  I have 3 dogs of all sizes:  110lb Chocolate Lab, 15lb Miniature Pinscher, 1lb Chihuahua.  All three dogs love this treat.  I give the whole piece to the Lab and then break another in half and give 1 half to the MinPin and the other half to the Chihuahua.  The first two devour this treat in seconds but it takes the Chihuahua half a day to make it through the treat.  I think that's good.  It gives him something to do and it'll clean his teeth too.  The treat is very crumbly if they break it apart.  My dogs always clean up the crumbs afterwards, but probably shouldn't feed this treat to them on the carpet.  All in all - I would highly recommend this product as a good, healthy, tasty treat for dogs that is hypoallergenic and can help break the tartar off their teeth.  It smells very clean and fresh, like a granola bar and the dogs love it!"}
