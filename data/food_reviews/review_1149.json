They are very similar to Cinnamon Toast Crunch. They do have a slight \"healthy\" taste, but it's hardly noticable. Even the kid's will enjoy this cereal which has an amazing amount of fiber in it - especially to taste so good (not like sticks)! I used to eat raisin bran b/c it had 7g of fiber and still tasted okay. Now I eat this, which has 9g of fiber and tastes awesome!<br />I highly recommend it. Oh, and the squares are small, about 1/2 the size of CTCrunch, so it's the perfect size for toddlers to pick up and eat. They'll think they are eating candy, but you'll know it's good for them ;)"}
