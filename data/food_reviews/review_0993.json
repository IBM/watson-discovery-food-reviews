Besides read the labels of products made right here--a vast majority of them contain toxic to humans & animals ingredients--everything from paint & varnish to the food is tainted with these toxic chemicals & all made right here in the U.S.A.  So, if you can trust a U.S. label--why not trust a Chinese label?  These treats are sure a hit with our dogs--all 7 of them love the chicken, lamb & rice, & the duck with glucosamine & chrondroitin.  We buy this type because of our older dogs with severe arthritis.  Our 15 yr. old was almost beyond walking until we started feeding him these snacks & our 9 yr. old Chihuahua's hip problems are much improved. On S&S these snacks are the cheapest price that we have found & with free shipping--Keep 'em coming Dogswell & Amazon--yes, even from the dreaded China."}
