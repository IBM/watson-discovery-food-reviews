I am on the paleo diet right now and these cookies are what I look forward too. I do like the taste of the tropical one the best. They all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place. I expected the taste to be different and it is. Other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy. Of course not.<br /><br />When I eat them, I don't even feel bad about it because my body welcomes them. They don't make me crash either and feel like I ate junk food. It is a good indicator that these were made from all natural ingredients. I wish I had these cookies close to me. I'd buy them every single day!"}
