I will never buy Pepsi or Coke products. At a minimum I will by Jones because they use pure cane sugar. I really enjoyed getting to try this product, and I am actually going on now to start ordering it on a regular basis.<br /><br />You can really tell the difference between \"pop\" and juice with sparkling water. It is a bit on the sweet side, and I did not think they needed to add the extra juice flavors to make it just right. However this is a great product, good size for individual servings, and it arrived in good packaging by amazon."}
