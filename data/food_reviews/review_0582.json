It was delivered as promised, arrived a little crushed, but with no damage to product. I prefer a strong brew of coffee, so it tasted a bit weak for my preference. I really didn't think there was anything special about the small bit of flavor it did have. I will try it again with a smaller brew setting... Keep in mind I love espresso so I'm a hard core coffee drinker.<br />I loved the non-plastic design, and it actually fit in my Cuisinart k-cup brewer even better than the regular k-cup! I think the design is the biggest plus because it also makes the price more reasonable. I might try this brand again, but will definitely see if they have a bolder brew."}
