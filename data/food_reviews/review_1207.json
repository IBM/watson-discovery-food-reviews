Great caffeinated beans (whatever \"great\" means to the drinker) are pretty easy to find. But when it comes to decaf, pickin's get VERY slim.<br /><br />Kicking Horse is the best decaf for me. It's an even, very dark (consider it a french) roast and it's oily! (The whole \"oily vs. not oily\" is a never-ending debate.) Suffice to say, I prefer dark, oily beans and it's impossible to find oily decaf from a mass-production roaster.<br /><br />Admittedly, I have not performed a side-by-side comparison with caffeinated, but straight shots are remarkable. Few people would recognize that they were drinking decaf if they were served this coffee. (espresso or press, i can't speak to the taste of this coffee after drip)<br /><br />To qualify any opinion, it's important to understand the perspective of the reviewer. I don't evaluate coffee for qualities like \"florals\" or \"dark chocolate\" or \"berries\". I like rich espresso flavor, but without so much caffeine. So I cut my coffee with a dark decaf in order to get the richness that I want, and then smooth it with a little milk/cream - no sweetener, no flavorings.<br /><br />As an added bonus, I really appreciate the 15% discount for the monthly automated Amazon subscription."}
