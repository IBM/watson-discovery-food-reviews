I was glad I found this product as it is even better than the one I used to use.  I LOVE IT!!!!  As a Hawaiian, I eat rice every day and I always sprinkle the Nori Komi on my hot steamed rice....mmmmmm..making me hungry!  I highly recommend this product.  Also, I received this product quickly and it was packed very well."}
