I am a veterinarian, and my cats are pretty spoiled. I have bought all kinds of treats, the Evo ones, the Friskies temptations, the Pounce, the Greenies, the moist hairball treats; you name it.  One of my cats is a piggy; you really can't trust her opinion. She'd eat anything.  However, my other cat is super finicky, and she simply adores these treats.  I also love that these appear so ethically made.  I can't always say a product is green just because it is green on the label; lots of manufacturers dupe consumers into buying \"natural\" products that aren't any healthier than the feline equivalent of a Snickers bar.  But after reading the label, I can't say I seriously knock this manufacturer. The ingredients look pretty good.  Can't say Amazon is the best place to buy these treats, though.  I saw em for 3.99 at another website.  So shop around, but when you get a good deal on these treats, buy them.  Your kitties will thank you.  And follow you all around the house begging loudly."}
