Never having had Wolfgang Puck's k-cups, I was hoping they'd be as good as the Wolfgang Puck coffee I've had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas, I was mistaken. I wouldn't say it's the worst I've had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too.  I feel like I'm drinking coffee that's been made with grounds that have already been perked.  In other words - the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and I'm getting leftovers.<br /><br />If you're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that doesn't really taste like much of anything, this is your pod.  If you're looking for better, richer flavors, stick with Green Mountain which sadly Amazon doesn't seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge $60 for a box!"}
