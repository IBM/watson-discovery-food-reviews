I love the french vanilla flavored variety they sell, so much so I've had to purchase additional (early) shipments from subscribe-n-save.  Unfortunately the hazelnut isn't so great, and not b/c it's 'convenient store' cappuccino either.  I prefer that over 'real' stuff.  It smells wonderful, but just something in the flavor that's lacking and it leaves a weird after taste.  Just wish I didn't buy the 36 count.  Definately buy the French Vanilla variety if you are trying to choose between the two."}
