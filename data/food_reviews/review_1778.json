Available when I need them. They don't seem to melt together when they get warm.  The white belly texture is almost like a toughened up version of marshmallowish texture. Interesting on the tongue.  The flavour of the frog is interesting as well.  Some say a pineapplish sort of green tea pear flavor. Same flavor as green frogs I've found in department store/food places, so I'm guessing its the universal frog flavor or the same brand more likely."}
