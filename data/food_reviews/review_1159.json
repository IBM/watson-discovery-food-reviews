But I am making a point of expressing my anger over this product. I buy lots of tea from many sources and white peony is one of my favorites. The package says it is organic and of the finest quality. It was possibly the worst tea I have ever tasted. In fact, after a couple of pots, I actually threw nearly the whole half pound in the trash. And the price wasn't even that good. I subsequently bought a pound of excellent organic white peony from Whole Foods for less. Whatever they are, this is not a tea company."}
