I cut up cantaloupe, apple, banana (even used sweet potatoes a few times)-- just whatever I could get at the restaurant-- and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat!  It's great because I didn't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks, and he got to try out new foods.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again."}
