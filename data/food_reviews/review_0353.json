I've already tried the reusable substitutes but I could never get the right grind of coffee beans to produce the coffee flavor/robustness that I like. This coffee is a great bargain for the price, especially with the Subscribe and Save. It is not my absolute favorite, I still prefer Newman's Own blend, but it is better tasting to me than other K Cup offerings(the Folgers blends for example).  I hope San Francisco Bay comes out with more dark/bold roasts because I would definitely try them."}
