You'd have to try this coffee for yourself. What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag.<br />I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices. This is probably why Keurig recently came out with a new brewer, \"the VUE\"  that uses different and patented cups."}
