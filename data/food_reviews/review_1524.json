They are very tasty and not too sweet!  Besides being gluten-free, these are also wheat-free and dairy-free. Most of the ingredients are also organic.<br /><br />The shape and size is almost like a cookie, and the consistency is soft, so if you like harder granola bars, you might not like these.  The oat and coconut tastes are dominant to me, and the chocolate taste is a bit lighter.  The chocolate chunks are also not too large, which I like since it means that I can keep these on hand in my car or purse, without having to worry about them melting.<br /><br />As for nutritional facts, each bar has 180 calories, 9 grams of fat (13% of your daily value), with 2 grams coming from saturated fat.  There are 23 grams of carbs, 2 grams (10% of daily value) of fiber, and 8 grams of sugar.  This makes them pretty comparable to other bars like Luna Bars and Larabars.<br /><br />Overall, I really like these and am glad I gave them a try.  I will definitely purchase more."}
