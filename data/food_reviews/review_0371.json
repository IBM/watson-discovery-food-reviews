High Calorie and Fat.","text":"I wanted to love this. I was even prepared for it to be somewhat like a cheap Circle K Cappuccino. Unfortunately, the product itself is really greasy. You actually see grease in the cup. It is 80 calories per serving and the taste it really really powder tasting, like powdered milk.  I wasn't expecting a Starbucks Cap out of the K-Cup, but I was expecting a little more than this.<br /><br />I read the reviews and they were sort of mixed, so I chose to try it, but I won't buy these again. They will sit on the top cupboard shelf till i am desperate I guess or throw them away. Three boxes of them... EESSSH<br /><br />I also now realize these aren't eligible for return... so that sucks. Oh well, buyer beware, right!"}
