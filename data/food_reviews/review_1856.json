This was the only dog food we could find that she wouldn't throw up. It was recommended by our vet who said our Bichon just had a lot of allergies and this food was known to work well with dogs having her problems.<br /><br />It's a bunch cheaper on amazon than any local pet store we could find, and we don't have to have the trouble of lugging the 30 lb bag home.<br /><br />However, the reason for the loss of 1 star -- our dog really dislikes the taste of it. She's on a pretty tight diet to lose weight currently and still refuses to eat the food immediately when poured into her bowl. She'll sniff it on and off for about an hour before eating it. It also gives her pretty bad breath, but these are both things I can live with to eliminate the stained carpets.<br /><br />We have been using the food for over 2 years with no problems; I definitely recommend it if your dog has a sensitive stomach."}
