If you love PB but never purchase a jar because you could eat an entire jar in a day or 2, this product is for you.  I loved FitzNuts PB until I bought PB2.  It is superior.  I have it on apples or cabbage.  I don't overeat it because you have to mix it up - takes seconds - with water.  I have even used it in recipes that call for 1/4 cup PB.  It works fine.<br />Just remember, it is not PB.  If you are a die-hard PB Connoisseur, this may not be for you but if you love PB but want something with less calories and fat, PB2 is for you!"}
