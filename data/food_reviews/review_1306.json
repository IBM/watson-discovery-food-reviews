The kids think it's pretty cool that they are eating \"astronaut food\".  Others have said they are expensive for what you get, but it's  kind of a novelty item and the variety was good for the price.  My problem was that the package showed up missing 5 of the listed items.  First reaction was to return to Amazon for a refund, but instead I emailed the seller and told them my Amazon shipment was missing items.  Within 24 hours I received a reply asking for my address so that they could ship me the missing items.  I received the missing items in just a couple days.  Sure, it would have been nice to received the items together all at once, but the seller making good on an honest mistake was greatly appreciated!"}
