Unlike the coffee's which i find to be a little strong for my liking this item was perfect! With the coffee i always use the large cup option and add a ton of cream & sugar to make it where it isnt sooo strong.  But the cappuccino is good even in the small cup option! It taste very much like what you buy at a good convenient store from one of their cappuccino machines!  Looking forward to when this becomes available again so I can order more.  You will really want to order this 3 pack instead of a single pack!"}
