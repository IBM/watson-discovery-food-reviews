I had read in many other reviews that the cans came dented.  For so reason I was hoping that this would be different for me.  Well, they arrived today.. dented.  One can isn't dented too bad and will still give as a gift.  The other can is too dented for me to consider gift-worthy.  I can't attest to the quality of the oil yet, because I haven't used it and nor has she.. I just wanted to get this review out to let people know that your cans will most like come dented in some way or an other.  In fact, mine came in a big box from Amazon with a few other purchases; Amazon seemed to wrap it well, but my guess is that the cans were dented before Amazon shipped them to me."}
