But you're on... a big ferry boat. With a single coffee vending machine. The kind that you wouldn't venture near if you had any choice in the matter. But you need a hot beverage, or the caffiene, or something warm to hold, whatever. So you bite. The paper cup shoots out of some recess in the machine, and a close approximation of coffee pours into said cup, with the familiar, but suspect aroma of vanilla in the air. Then you taste it - and yup, it's exactly as vending machine icky as you hoped it wouldn't be. You taste the artificial, and you learn to settle for it. Because you're stuck on a boat.<br /><br />Well, Grove Square Capuccino Cups, French Vanilla - are just a little better than that. A smidgen better, not much more.<br /><br />So if you aren't stuck on a ferry boat (or train station, or gas station, or local DMV waiting area or someplace equally dismal), and if you actually do have a choice, I would urge you to at least try before you buy. So you aren't stuck with 23 k-cups that make you cringe :)"}
