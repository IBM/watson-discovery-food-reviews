Huge step up over other baby foods we've tried!  Just wish there were more flavors to choose from...<br /><br />However, we've stopped buying this product based on Amazon's RIDICULOUS amount of packaging for it.  One of the reason I liked this product was that I felt greener using a baby food without the glass jars.  However, in order to ship 32 packets of powder, Amazon put the 4 small boxes of 8 powder packets into a bigger box, surrounded the bigger box with plastic padding, and put that box inside an even bigger box!  As if they were worried the powder packets would break?!  See the attached picture.  We bought it ~4 times and same over-kill packaging every time.  Even if you're not concerned about the environmental impact, it was annoying to break down and dispose of that much packaging just for a few things of baby food."}
