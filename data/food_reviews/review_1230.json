These white meat chunk chicken in cans are great, because I'm terrible at meal planning.  All of a sudden, I'll be hungry NOW, with no time to cook.<br /><br />So I open a can of this Swanson chicken, drain it, dump it into a tupperware, add a couple heaping tablespoons of lite Miracle Whip, and start mashing at the chunks with a fork.  I scoop up the newly made chicken salad with saltine, Ritz, or butter club crackers.  Ta-da, instant protein-filled meal.  This chicken would be great for serving to kids, too.  I ALWAYS have cans of this in my cupboards.  I can add some more flavor by adding ground black pepper, mustard, relish, and other kitchen staples.<br /><br />It is cheaper at my local stores.  But, if you can't get out to the store, I've always had great service from amazon!"}
