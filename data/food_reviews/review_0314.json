The good news is, they're delicious.  Both the hubby and I are enjoying them.  I wish I could put them in my K-Cup carousel, but I guess I can live without that little perk in exchange for a more affordable K-cup that still tastes great.  I don't understand why people complaining about them going stale don't put them in a ziploc bag after opening.  We consume at least four cups of coffee per day in our house, so we go through one bag of 12 in 3 days or less.  That's not enough time for the coffee to go stale inside a zip loc bag!  Give these a try.  I am going to be sampling the other blends, for sure."}
